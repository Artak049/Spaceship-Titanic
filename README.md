# Spaceship-Titanic
(Problem from kaggle)


This is what I did to get an 74.9% accuracy on my Spaceship Titanic competition submission, as pretty much a beginner. But it is far from perfect and I would really appreciate any constructive feedback on this project.

Since I knew extremely little about all the machine learning models and hyperparameters and what-not when I was working on this, I just decided to follow the basics and do my best to fill null values as accurately as possible. Then I just trained and predicted using the basic models that I knew, and a couple I know nothing about (haha dw I'll learn them soon).
